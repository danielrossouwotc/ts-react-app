# Features Folder

The **Features folder** is a structural approach in React app development that enhances modularity, scalability, and organization. It involves grouping related components, services, and logic into self-contained feature modules.

## Benefits

- **Modularity**: Isolate components, styles, and logic within dedicated feature folders, simplifying maintenance and testing.

- **Scalability**: Easily integrate new features without disrupting existing code, promoting code reusability and team collaboration.

- **Readability**: Enhance code discoverability by keeping feature-specific code together, aiding developers in understanding and locating relevant code.

- **Isolation**: Prevent unintended interactions between features, reducing bugs and unexpected behavior.

## Structure

The Features folder follows this format:

```
src/
└── features/
    ├── Feature1/
    │   ├── components/
    │   ├── services/
    │   ├── hooks/
    │   ├── utils/
    │   ├── ...
    │   └── index.ts
    ├── Feature2/
    │   ├── ...
    └── ...
```

The folder structure within the feature will sort of be a mini version of the src structure (without the features folder of course)

- `components`: Reusable UI components for the feature.
- `services`: Backend interactions.
- `hooks`: Custom logic-sharing hooks.
- `utils`: Feature-related utility functions.
- `index.js`: Entry point exporting the feature's public APIs - Only Export what is going to be used outside the feature.

## Best Practices

- **Single Responsibility**: Keep features focused and purposeful. Features should typically not speak with other features.

- **Consistency**: Maintain uniform folder structures for easy navigation. If done once; stick with it to avoid confusion

- **Naming**: Choose clear, descriptive names for features and components.
